- Currently, a Business Analyst at **VSS-Southern Theatres, LLC** where I manage our **Employee** and **Customer Research** efforts through our **Customer Satisfaction Program** and **Employee** survey projects. I use **R**, **SQL** and [**Qualtrics**](https://www.qualtrics.com) to assist me with gathering, analyzing, modeling and reporting on the **Voice of Customer** and **Employees**. I have fun working on a variety of problems from predicting movie attendance to extracting meaning from customer comments utilizing **Natural Language Processing**.
