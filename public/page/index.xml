      <description>Currently, a Business Analyst at VSS-Southern Theatres, LLC where I manage our Employee and Customer Research efforts through our Customer Satisfaction Program and Employee survey projects. I use R, SQL and Qualtrics to assist me with gathering, analyzing, modeling and reporting on the Voice of Customer and Employees. I have fun working on a variety of problems from predicting movie attendance to extracting meaning from customer comments utilizing Natural Language Processing.</description>
